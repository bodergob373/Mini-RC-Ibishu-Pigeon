# Mini RC Ibishu Pigeon

## Description
A mini 3d-printed RC car based off of the Ibishu Pigeon from BeamNG.drive. It has rear independent suspension and a single front wheel. It's powered by a 7.4V battery and the H-bridge PWM DC esc is built from scratch. It can maybe drift too.

## Why?
Pigeons are funny and a tiny RC one would be cool.
